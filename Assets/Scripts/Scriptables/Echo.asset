    statement: "Yea the Twilight is cool and all. I mean it\u2019s much better than
      just sitting around doing nothing. I can\u2019t even go out and rake up the
      autumn leaves before an automatic raker comes and does the job for me at 5am
      before I get up. I guess we are just expected to just sit around and watch
      entertainment every day now. Between that and the Twilight, I choose the Twilight
      every day."

    author: Slightly Unhappy Customer
    statement: "Was this the best that they could come up with for the Twilight?
      I mean sure, its better than just staying isolated at home but c\u2019mon.
      Couldn\u2019t someone at that giant company have put up some art, add some
      music? This place is missing soul. Even with all that the real world is still
      worse. So I'm staying here."

    author: Nate Thorson
    statement: "The thing about the Twilight is that you don\u2019t ever know that
      you were inside of it until your time is up. It\u2019s a shame that they limit
      you to 12 hours inside the Twilight at a time. They don\u2019t have a good
      reason for it other than forcing us to come back to the real world, which sucks."

    author: Steve Bowman
    statement: "At first I wondered how the Twilight was perfect for everyone but
      then my buddy explained it to me. The drones create a separate vision for each
      individual based on their deepest desires. I don\u2019t understand how it works
      but I swear it is magic."

    author: Julie Jett
    statement: "It was hard for me to realize it for a long time but I started to
      realize that it is impossible that my life is this perfect. I remembered that
      I entered the Twilight and I\u2019ve been here for a long time now. I don\u2019t
      know how to exit it at this point. I never thought about it before. Am I trapped\u2026
      but in paradise?"

    author: Khai Nguyen
    statement: So I heard that Twilight have a wave of new hires. That is total crap.
      I have been top of my class for as long as I can remember and I never even
      got a response for my job applications. How did they get in? What makes them
      so special?

    author: Andy Minchin
    statement: "I don\u2019t know how those new people managed to get into Twilight
      Inc. It seems impossible but they deserve it. The Twilight looks amazing now
      with the designs all over the walls. I wonder why the Twilight couldn\u2019t
      be like this before."

    author: Kianna, just Kianna
    statement: "I don\u2019t understand why the Twilight puts a time limit on how
      long you can stay in the illusion. Can\u2019t we stay here if we want to? I
      don\u2019t think my family even cares about me. At least my illusion family
      accepts me for who I am. Come to think of it, when was the last time I logged
      out?"

    author: Anya Tinnon
    statement: "I\u2019m starting to feel bad for my friend. She never wanted to
      use the Twilight. She said that it was giving up on the \u201Creal\u201D world.
      I guess she just got tired of all of us praising it and making her feel left
      out. I know she loves it when she\u2019s inside but I see how sad she is when
      she isn\u2019t."

    author: George Miranda
    statement: "Most people don\u2019t understand that this illusion isn\u2019t only
      supposed to be about finding pleasure. It\u2019s also about finding purpose.
      I was a truck driver all my life and did I like it? No. But it was my job and
      I earned my living doing it. When the machines took that from me then the only
      option I had was to continue driving in the Twilight. Or else I just wouldn\u2019t
      feel like me anymore."

    author: Melvin Moore
    statement: "The more stuff that gets added, the more I just want to stay in the
      illusion. It\u2019s like it has become my real life now. I would prefer it
      that way at least. Being logged out is like our cruel punishment for being
      human. Or perhaps it is our punishment for letting that company control our
      minds in the first place."

    author: Mr. Arnold
    statement: "I\u2019m writing this hoping that someone will read it someday. The
      Twilight is wonderful. I got a terminal illness that my health plan wasn\u2019t
      able to cure. So I\u2019ve known that I only had months to live for a while
      now. If not for the Twilight, my last days would have been miserable. Twilight
      Inc, Thank you."

    author: Jordan Smith
    statement: This giant illusion that everybody is addicted to is amazing. I mean
      before dreamtech was a thing, I used to be lazy all the time. Even before it
      was cool. Now that dreamtech is here, everybody is lazy. So now nobody can
      judge me for doing the exact same thing that everybody does now.
