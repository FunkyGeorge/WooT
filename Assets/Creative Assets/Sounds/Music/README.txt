Casual Gaming: Free Music Loop Pack 01

Version : 1.1.0
Author : Pierre-Clément KERNEIS

This is a free background music pack suitable for a variety of games such as :
- Platformers
- Puzzle and Reflexion
- Rhythm
- Simulation
- Designed for simplicity

Import the audio file in your favorite editor, enable looping and you’re ready to go!

What’s the catch ?
There is none. I think a good game needs tailor-made music. 
This free pack is aimed at small teams or individuals looking for quality audio assets for a game jam, a prototype or a trailer. 
A mention in the credits would be appreciated. (e.g. "Composer: P-C. KERNEIS").

If you like what you hear, I’d be happy to write the original soundtrack of your next game.
